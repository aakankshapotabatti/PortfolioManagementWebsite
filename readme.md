## Title
Portfolio Management: A Responsive Web Application for Stock Portfolio Tracking

## Objective of Project
To develop a user-friendly, mobile-responsive web application that enables users to manage their stock portfolios without relying on external frameworks or libraries. The application aims to provide real-time stock tracking, facilitate buying and selling of stocks, and offer personalized investment recommendations while maintaining data security through local storage.

## Problem Statement
Individual investors often struggle with tracking their investment portfolios across multiple platforms, which can lead to inefficient decision-making and missed opportunities. Many existing solutions are either overly complex, require paid subscriptions, or don't provide a comprehensive view of one's investments. Additionally, casual investors need an intuitive interface that works seamlessly across devices while maintaining privacy and security of financial data.

## Conclusion/Outcome
The Portfolio Management web application successfully addresses these challenges by providing:

1. A secure authentication system that protects user data through local storage encryption
2. An intuitive dashboard displaying live stock prices and portfolio performance
3. Streamlined functionality for buying and selling stocks with real-time balance updates
4. Personalized stock recommendations based on market sectors
5. Full responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices

By implementing these features using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the application delivers a lightweight yet powerful solution for individual investors to track, manage, and grow their investment portfolios without requiring external dependencies or compromising on security or user experience.
